# Supply-And-Demand

Neural networks simulate supply and demand by selling products in their own shops.<br />
6 shops compete for customers and try to find a perfect price to maximize profits.<br />
At the end of every day, shops recalculate their prices with the statistics of the passed day.<br />
At the end of every week, 2 shops with the most profits are selected and they mutate to form 3 new shops each.

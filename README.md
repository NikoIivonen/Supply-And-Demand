# Supply-And-Demand

Neural networks simulate supply and demand by selling products in their own shops.<br />
Shops compete for customers and try to find a balance between price and quality to maximize profits.<br />
At the end of every day, shops recalculate their prices with the statistics of the passed day.<br />
At the end of every time period, shops with the most profits are selected and they mutate to form the next generation.
